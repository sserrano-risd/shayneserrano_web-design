        "description": "The Brownsville Community Center for Health and Wellness began as a collaborative community service project and evolved into an ambitious campaign to bring about social change. My design studio worked in conjunction with City Tech’s nursing department to create the perfect program for a proposed community center in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Through a joint effort of diligent research and volunteer work, we were able to come up with a list of spaces we felt would address Brownsville’s high rates in crime, poverty, asthma, and obesity. I then implemented these spaces into my individual design, which is an innovative interpretation of the local public housing. My design reads as the crossing of two L-shaped forms; the intersection pinpointed by a 3-story glass atrium. This circular, multi-story space houses a climate controlled indoor park to create a public garden for residents suffering from asthma. The indoor garden overlooks the below grade fitness center, comprised of a gymnasium, natatorium, and an exercise room. The bi-level public library, second floor classrooms, and auditorium confront crime and poverty by allowing the room for educational programs, research, and productive, artistic endeavors for the community. The third and fourth floors provide a medical center, higher education nursing classrooms, and geriatric planting beds. As a result of our efforts, 20 architecture students were selected to present their designs to the public at Brooklyn Borough Hall in hopes of sparking an era of change for Brownsville."
